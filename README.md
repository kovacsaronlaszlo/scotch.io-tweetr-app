# My own comment:

I have created this gadget so that I can better understand the 
javascript server side logic. Mostly I work on the front end and I have 
a bit of time to dedicate it to learning javascript. If possible, 
I try to understand the MVC logic, so I decided to do that with the scoop 
of the scotch.io. The link can be viewed here:
